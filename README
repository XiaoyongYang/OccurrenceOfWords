# This project is to create a Java program that counts unique words from a text file and lists the top 10 occurrences.

# For test, please put tempest.txt under C:\Users
# Another alternative solution is to create a configuration file to specify the path of tempest.txt file

# The sorting values are the occurances of the words from tempest.txt file.
# This sorting method will list the sorting values from maximum value to minimum value.

# Need to define the regular expression in searching text strings for processing the text file.

# Use the supplied text file (tempest.txt), English locale and treating hyphen and apostrophe as part of a word, it should match the following output:
and (514)
the (513)
i (446)
to (324)
a (310)
of (295)
my (288)
you (211)
that (188)
this (185)
